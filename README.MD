## Goal

FOLIO compatible persistent storage of loans, loan policies, circulation rules,
requests, and fixed due date schedules

## API

### Where the API code lives

The implementation java files live in the
[`/src/main/java/org/folio/rest/impl`](src/main/java/org/folio/rest/impl)
package. These implement the actual
java interfaces, to be found in the
[`/src/main/java/org/folio/rest/jaxrs/resource`](src/main/java/org/folio/rest/jaxrs/resource)
package, which are automatically generated from the `raml` files in
[`/ramls/`](ramls).

Corresponding API tests can be found in the
[`/src/test/java/org/folio/rest/api`](src/test/java/org/folio/rest/api)
package.

### API documentation

The API documentation generated from the `*.raml` files can be found online at
[https://dev.folio.org/reference/api/#mod-circulation-storage](https://dev.folio.org/reference/api/#mod-circulation-storage)


## Implementation Specific Behaviours

As a FOLIO interface is limited to describing the protocol (HTTP endpoints and
the structure of expected requests and responses) between the client and server
there are behaviors which go beyond this definition and are implementation specific,
some of which are noted below.

### Only one Open Loan per Item

This implementation introduces the constraint that only one loan can be open for a
given item.

HTTP Requests (either POST or PUT) which could result in two loans with the
same `itemId` and the `status` of `Open` should be rejected with a error (422) response

### Unique Position in per-item Request Queue

This implementation introduces the constraint that only one open (e.g. `Open - Not yet filled`) request
for a given item can be at a particular position in the request queue for that item.

HTTP Requests (either POST or PUT) which could result two open requests with the
same `itemId` and `position` should be rejected with a error (422) response

### Known Limitations

#### Anonymization SQL

At the moment, this is constructed with string concatenation (it will hopefully soon be replaced by prepared statements).

The `userId` parameter is checked to take the form of a UUID to try to reduce the exposure of this.

## Prerequisites

## Required

- Java 11 JDK
- Maven 3.3.9
- Docker ([minimum requirements](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/))
- PostgreSQL 9.6.1 (running and listening on the default port, logged in user must have admin rights), with the following extensions
  - pgcrypto
  - unaccent
  - pg_trgm
- Kafka 2.6 (running and listening on localhost:9092)

### Optional

- Python 3.6.0 (for un-registering module during managed deployment scripts, and the lint-raml tools)

## Preparation

### Git Submodules

There are some common RAML definitions that are shared between FOLIO projects via Git submodules.

To initialise these please run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the root directory.

If these are not initialised, the inventory-storage module will fail to build correctly, and other operations may also fail.

More information is available on the [developer site](https://dev.folio.org/guides/developer-setup/#update-git-submodules).

### PostgreSQL

Run the `setup-test-db.sh` script in the inventory-storage directory to setup Postgres with a database to be used in tests.
This is only required to run tests against an external Postgres instance, the default is to use an embedded Postgres instance.

### Kafka

Mod-circulation-storage implements domain event pattern and requires kafka to be listening to
`localhost:9092`. You can override kafka port and host by setting `KAFKA_PORT` and
`KAFKA_HOST` environment variables.

For production deployments it is also required to set `REPLICATION_FACTOR`
env variable, this property has following description:
> The replication factor controls how many servers will replicate each message that is written.
> If replication factor set to 3 then up to 2 servers can fail before access to the data will be lost.

The default configuration for this property is `1`, for production environments
it is usually `3`.

There is another important property - `number of partitions` for a topic - it has following
description:
> The partition count controls how many logs the topic will be sharded into.

This property has fixed value - `10`.

## Common activities

### Checking the RAML and JSON.Schema definitions

Follow the [guide](https://dev.folio.org/guides/raml-cop/) to use raml-cop to assess RAML, schema, and examples.

# Local Deployment using Docker

## Preparation

Execute `mvn clean package` to build the jar artefact needed for building a Docker image

## Start the infrastructure

Clone `https://github.com/folio-org/folio-tools/`

Navigate to the folder `infrastructure/local` directory within the cloned repository

Execute `docker compose up -d` to start the infrastructure containers needed to run the module

## Start the Module

In the root of this repository, execute `docker compose up -d` to deploy the module

## Stop the Module

In the root of this repository, execute `docker compose down` to undeploy the module

## Stop the infrastructure

Navigate to the folder `infrastructure/local` directory within the clone of the folio-tools repository

Execute `docker compose down` to stop the infrastructure containers

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Dates and times

A loan has the date and time when and item was leant to a user and when it was returned. The module expects them to be represented in [RFC3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-3).

At the moment, the JSON.schema for loan does provide validation for these (it will eventually use the date-time format included in the standard when this is supported by the RAML module builder).

## Design notes

### Request status transition

There is database trigger for request update. It works in the following way:

Given a request with status 'Open - Awaiting pickup'<br/>
When the request is updated and new status is 'Closed - Pickup expired' or 'Closed - Cancelled'<br/>
Then an update trigger adds the property 'awaitingPickupRequestClosedDate' to the request JSONB<br/>

Such behavior is required by Expired Holds Report CSV functionality in mod-circulation<br/>
See [CIRC-320](https://issues.folio.org/browse/CIRC-320)

### Requests Batch API

In order to go through `itemId`-`position` constraint for **request** table we're removing all positions
for requests as the first operation of batch, before executing the updates.

Let's say we have following requests in batch package:
* *Request A*;
* *Request B*;
* *Request C*.

Then, in order to execute them successfully and do not get constraint violation we're
removing positions for these request, so we will do:
1. `UPDATE requests SET jsonb = jsonb - 'position' WHERE id IN (A, B, C)`;
1. `UPDATE requests SET jsonb = A WHERE id = A`;
1. `UPDATE requests SET jsonb = B WHERE id = B`;
1. `UPDATE requests SET jsonb = C WHERE id = C`;

# Domain event pattern

The pattern means that every time when a domain entity is created/updated/removed
a message is posted to kafka topic. Currently domain events are supported for _loans_, _requests_, _check-in_ entities. 
The events are posted into the following topics: 
* `circulation.loan` - for loans;
* `circulation.request` - for requests;
* `circulation.check-in` - for check-in records.

The event payload has following structure:
```javascript
{
  "id": "12bb13f6-d0fa-41b5-b0ad-d6561975121b",  // event UUID
  "type": "CREATED|UPDATED|DELETED|ALL_DELETED", // type of the event
  "tenant": "diku",                              // tenant name
  "timestamp": 1642707670092,                    // event creation timestamp in Unix Epoch time 
  "data": {
    "old": {...},                                // the entity before update or delete
    "new": {...},                                // the entity after update or create  
  }
}
```

`X-Okapi-Url` and `X-Okapi-Tenant` headers are set from the request to the kafka message.

Kafka partition key for all the events is **entity id**.

## Domain events for delete all APIs

There are delete all APIs for loan and request records. For such
APIs we're issuing a special domain event of `ALL_DELETED` type:
* Partition key: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
* Event payload:
```javascript
{
  "id": "12bb13f6-d0fa-41b5-b0ad-d6561975121b",
  "type": "ALL_DELETED",
  "tenant": "diku",
  "timestamp": 1642707670092
}
```
