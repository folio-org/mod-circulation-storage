# Goal

FOLIO compatible persistent storage of loans.

# Prerequisites

# Required

- Java 8 JDK
- Maven 3.3.9
- PostgreSQL 9.6.1 (running and listening on the default port, logged in user must have admin rights)

## Optional

- Node.js 6.4 (for API linting)
- NPM 3.10 (for API linting)
- Python 3.6.0 (for parts of the deployment scripts)

# Preparation

## Git Submodules

There are some common RAML definitions that are shared between FOLIO projects via Git submodules.

To initialise these please run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the root directory.

If these are not initialised, the inventory-storage module will fail to build correctly, and other operations may also fail.

More information is available on the [developer site](http://dev.folio.org/doc/setup#update-git-submodules).

## PostgreSQL

Run the `setup-test-db.sh` script in the inventory-storage directory to setup Postgres with a database to be used in tests.
This is only required to run tests against an external Postgres instance, the default is to use an embedded Postgres instance.

# Common activities

## Checking the RAML and JSON.Schema definitions

run `./lint.sh` to validate the RAML and JSON.Schema descriptions of the API (requires node.js and NPM)

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Dates and times

A loan has the date and time when and item was leant to a user and when it was returned. The module expects them to be represented in [RFC3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-3).

At the moment, the JSON.schema for loan does provide validation for these (it will eventually use the date-time format included in the standard when this is supported by the RAML module builder).
